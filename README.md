## This is a draft of a gameboy emulator written in Rust.

Here are the resources that I used to built it:
- https://rylev.github.io/DMG-01/public/book/graphics/tile_ram.html
- https://gekkio.fi/files/gb-docs/gbctr.pdf

### What's implemented:
- The main skeleton of the emulator
  - The CPU logic
  - Memory
  - Graphics memory
- Some instructions

### What needs to be done:
- Add remaining instructions
- Handle inputs
- Handle display
